Project Title: Integrated Performance Monitoring Stack for Proxmox VE with Workload Analysis

This project focuses on resource utilization and performance analysis of virtual machines in Proxmox VE under varying workloads. The primary objective is to develop an application-based tool that integrates with the Proxmox VE environment by configuring the system to transmit performance data to InfluxDB, which is integrated with Grafana for logging, visualization, and alerting when workloads exceed predefined thresholds. Through this tool, we can proactively address the possible issues and be able to restore the system to its optimal operation expeditiously.
